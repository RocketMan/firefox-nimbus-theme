## Description

This theme makes Firefox look more like epiphany/GNOME Web when
running under the [slim-nimbus](https://github.com/RocketMan/solaris-ports/tree/master/components/look-and-feel/slim-nimbus) theme that can be found in
the solaris-ports repo.  The theme is based on Rafael Mardojai's Firefox
Adwaita theme.  See the upstream branch or the upstream repo for information
on the original code.

It has been tested on Firefox 68 esr - Firefox 140 esr under Solaris 11.3.
